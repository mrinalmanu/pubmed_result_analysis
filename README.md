# pubmed_results_analysis
Analyses of pubmed search results in R and Python.

Will upload the final version as a seperate folder within this repo.

Files with '_all' prefixes are the newer ones

Features that could be implemented later:
- GUI search window, with options for analyses. Download reports as HTML.
